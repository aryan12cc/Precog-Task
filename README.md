# A-T-L-A-S Atlas!

For simplicity, the player starting the game is Player 1, and the other player is Player 2.

## Setup
The setup assumes that `pip` and `python3` are installed locally.

Clone the repository locally using 
```
git clone https://github.com/aryan12cc/Precog-Task.git
```

Change the current working directory using 
```
cd Precog-Task
```

Install all requirements required for the project by writing the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All task-1 related work has been done in `task1-graph-analysis.py`, and the results are stored in `task1-results`.

Similarly, task-2 related work has been done in `task2-community-detection.py` and the results are stored in `task2-results`.

The report for the task is in `Report.pdf`.
